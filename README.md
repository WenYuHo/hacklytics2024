# Mental Health Trends Visualization

This interactive visualization explores global trends in mental health disorders over the past 20 years. The analysis is based on the dataset from Kaggle titled "Uncover Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder). The visualization is designed to provide users with a dynamic and insightful experience, allowing them to filter data based on country and observe the evolution of major mental health disorders, including Depression, Alcohol Use, Eating Disorders, and Drug Use.

## Visualization Link
You can access the interactive visualization on Tableau Public by following this link: [Mental Health Trends Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tony.ho6073/viz/hack2024/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

## Issues with Tableau Cloud Rendering
Please note that the animation feature may not render correctly in Tableau Cloud due to the combined complexity of parameter inputs, country filter, year filter, and actions. To ensure a seamless experience, it is recommended to use Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server for the best results.

## Features and Functionality
1. **Filtering by Country and Year:** Users can filter the data based on specific countries and observe how major mental health disorders have evolved over the last two decades.

2. **Major Mental Health Disorders:** The visualization focuses on four significant mental health disorders - Depression, Alcohol Use, Eating Disorders, and Drug Use.

3. **Zooming into Trend Lines:** Instead of relying on animated filled maps, users have the option to zoom in on trend lines, providing a detailed and granular view of the data.

4. **Potential Future Analysis:** The visualization sets the foundation for future analysis, which may include exploring forecasting models, creating heat maps, and incorporating additional layers of insights.

## How to Use
1. Open the visualization link: [Mental Health Trends Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tony.ho6073/viz/hack2024/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
2. Explore the filters for country and year to focus on specific data points.
3. Zoom in on trend lines to closely examine the trends in major mental health disorders.
